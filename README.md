# Fortran-Neural-Network
First attempt at programming a neural network with Fortran (GFortran).

The purpose of this project is to:
1. Learn how to use git and github (since this is my first project)
2. Learn to code in Fortran
3. Learn about programming neural networks

Sources/tutorials I'm currently following are:
* [This book](https://www.amazon.com/Explained-Numerical-Mathematics-Scientific-Computation/dp/0199601429) on Fortran.
* [This series of videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6aCibgK1PTWWu9by6XFdCfh) for neural networks (in JavaScript).
* [This online book](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) as additional material on neural networks (in Python).
